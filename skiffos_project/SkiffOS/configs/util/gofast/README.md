# Skiff GoFast

util/gofast is a utility package which enables the latest toolchain, maximum
optimizations + acceleration (to a reasonable extent, with -Ofast), kernel
options to tune for performance, and other more experimental adjustments.

All of the Skiff packages are designed with stability in mind, but due to the
experimental / "risky" nature of these flags, util/gofast should be used only
when performance is more important than stability.
